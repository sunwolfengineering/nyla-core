# Nyla Analytics Core - Refactor Plan

**Target**: Transform current codebase into GPL v3 dual-licensed open-core analytics engine with single-site support and integrated dashboard.

## üéØ Executive Summary

**Goal**: Refactor Nyla into a single-binary, single-site analytics core that:
- Combines API server and dashboard into one process
- Enforces single site (`site_id = "default"`) throughout
- Implements clean extension points for commercial features
- Provides essential analytics: pageviews, sessions, real-time visitors
- Uses SQLite with proper migrations and schema from specs
- Achieves 80%+ test coverage with full CI/CD

## üìä Current State Analysis

### ‚ùå Problems to Fix
- **Two binaries**: `cmd/api` + `cmd/ui` violates single-binary requirement
- **Multi-site leakage**: Code accepts arbitrary `site_id` values
- **Outdated schema**: Database doesn't match `specs/database-schema.md`
- **Incomplete dashboard**: Only basic real-time card implemented
- **No extensions**: No plugin interfaces for commercial features
- **License mismatch**: AGPL headers instead of GPL v3
- **Minimal testing**: Low coverage, no CI pipeline

### ‚úÖ Current Strengths
- Go backend with SQLite foundation
- Basic event collection working
- elem-go templating system functional
- Repository structure established

## üìã Refactor Phases

### Phase 1: Repository Restructuring (Week 1)
**Goal**: Reorganize codebase and remove multi-site assumptions

#### Tasks:
1. **Merge binaries**
   - Delete `cmd/api/` and `cmd/ui/`
   - Create `cmd/nyla-core/main.go` as single entry point
   - Move HTTP server logic to `internal/server/`

2. **Enforce single-site**
   - Add constant `const DefaultSiteID = "default"` in central location
   - Remove multi-site parameters from all functions
   - Add validation: reject any `site_id != "default"` with HTTP 400

3. **Package reorganization**
   - Move business logic to `internal/services/`
   - Create `internal/storage/` for database operations
   - Move UI logic to `internal/dashboard/`

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Single `cmd/nyla-core/main.go` builds successfully
- [ ] All code references single default site
- [ ] Package structure matches target architecture
- [ ] No multi-site logic remains in codebase

### Phase 2: Database Layer (Week 1-2)

## üöÄ Implementation Guidelines

### Code Organization Principles
1. **Dependency Injection**: Use interfaces for all external dependencies
2. **Single Responsibility**: Each package has one clear purpose
3. **Testability**: All business logic easily unit testable
4. **Extension Points**: Well-defined interfaces for commercial features

### Database Guidelines
1. **Migrations Only**: Never modify schema directly
2. **Backwards Compatibility**: Support upgrade paths
3. **Performance**: Proper indexing for analytics queries
4. **Integrity**: Foreign key constraints enforced

### API Design
1. **RESTful**: Follow REST conventions for data endpoints
2. **Hypermedia**: Dashboard uses HTMX for interactivity
3. **Versioning**: All API endpoints versioned (`/v1/`)
4. **Documentation**: OpenAPI specs for all endpoints

### Security Requirements
1. **Input Validation**: All user inputs validated and sanitized
2. **Rate Limiting**: Basic protection against abuse
3. **Privacy**: IP anonymization enabled by default
4. **CORS**: Properly configured for cross-origin requests

## üìö Testing Strategy

---

**Next Steps**: Begin Phase 1 by creating the new directory structure and merging the binary entry points. Each phase should be completed in order, with acceptance criteria verified before proceeding.

This plan provides a comprehensive roadmap for transforming Nyla into a clean, testable, and extensible open-core analytics platform while maintaining the essential simplicity that makes it attractive for self-hosting.
